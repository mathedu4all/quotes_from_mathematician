# quotes_from_mathematician
a collection of quotes from mathematician with translations.

## Plan

- we first scrape all the related resoures from internet, and parse them to structrued data including author, author's life dates, source etc.
- and render them into a raw text file using restructuredText.
- then we can contribute to this projects in collaboration, adding more info or add translations etc.
- we can use then this file to get a random quotes, sounds facinating.
